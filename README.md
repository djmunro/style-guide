Davids Style Guide
==================

These style guides aim to document Trey Hunner's preferred style for writing Python code and more.


Background
----------

A friend (friends always ask the hardest questions) asked whether I had a recommendation for a good code style guide and I said no.

This repository is my effort at working toward my own default code style guide that I actually admire.


Goals
-----

- [ ] Create an opinionated Python style guide
- [ ] Create a style guide for documentation and rich text

Possible future goals:

- [ ] Create a JavaScript style guide
